## Background

Single-cell RNA (scRNA-seq) technologies are now emerging as a powerful tool to capture transcriptoe-wide cell-to-cell variability. ScRNA-seq enables the qunatification of intro-population  heterogeneity at a much higher resolution, potentially revealing dynamics in heterogeneous cell populations and complex tissues. 

One important characteristic of scRNA-seq data is the 'dropout' phenomenon, where a gene is observed at a moderate expression level in one cell but undetected in another cell. Since this characteristic is dependent on protocol, statistical or computational methods developed for scRNA-seq need to take the dropout issue into condisderation, otherwise they may present varying efficacy when applied to data generated from different protocols.
